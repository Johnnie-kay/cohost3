        <h2>OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMME (OOP)</h2>
        <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures software design around objects
            rather than functions or logic. These objects represent real-world entities and are instances of classes,
            which define the object's properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).</p>
            
            <h2> four main principles of OOP are</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>ENCAPSULATION: Bundling data (properties) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class</li>
                <li>ABSTRACTION: Hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of the object.
                </li>
                <li>INHERITANCE: Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reuse.
                </li>
                <li>POLYMORPHISM: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, making it easier to interchange objects without altering the code.
                </li>
            </ol>
